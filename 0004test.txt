How to Improve Your Study Habits
Perhaps you are an average student with average intelligence.You do well enough in school,but you probably think you will never be a top student.This is not necessarily the case,however.You can receive better grades if you want to.Yes,even students of average intelligence can be top students without additional work.Here's how:
1.Plan your time carefully.Make a list of your weekly tasks.Then make a schedule or chart of your time.Fill in committed time such as eating,sleeping,meetings,classes,etc.Then decide on good,regular times for studying.Be sure to set aside enough time to complete your normal reading and work assignments.Of course,studying shouldn't occupy all of the free time on the schedule.It's important to set aside time for relaxation,hobbies,and entertainment as well.This weekly schedule may not solve all of your problems,but it will make you more aware of how you spend your time.Furthermore,it will enable you to plan your activities so that you have adequate time for both work and play.
